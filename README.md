# Spudify User Manual
*Spudify* is a project for Database Management with the intention of enabling users to take control of their audio preferences. Whether that includes songs, podcast episodes, or comedy specials, users are able to access our database of carefully selected auditory media and create unlimited playlists to their heartâ€™s content.

There are two components within this documentation:

1. Setup & Installation
2. Walkthrough & Navigation

## Setup & Installation
  The setup and installation involves setting up the database, editing the correct files, and starting up the application with the correct data loaded. This procedure should simple as long as all the pre-requisites are covered.

### Clone Repsitory
  The repository must first be cloned to ease the package dependencies and installation. Additionally, it should be noted that the development of the application was under **Pycharm Professional**; therefore, to properly run the application without any issues, use the IDE developed under - Pycharm Community edition is also permissible.

To clone the repository, run the following command:

```
git clone https://www.github.com/momenabdelkarim/cse-412-class-project/
```

### Dependencies
  For the database and application to work, the following dependencies must be installed beforehand with the associated versions:

1. PostgreSQL (v12.4+)
2. Python (v3.8)
3. PyQT5 (v5.15.1)
4. Psychopg2 (Binary v2.8.6)

To install the two Python packages, simply enter the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

## Walkthrough & Navigation

## Set Up
I don't know how this part works and setting up the database with the frontend in a way that will work for the TA? how to install the dependencies and whatnot

they set up their own database and we just give instructions on how to get it all up

## Walkthrough
I'll do the walkthrough with the UI and screenshots explaining the steps
